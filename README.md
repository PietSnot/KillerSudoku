# KillerSudoku
killersudoku, initial version
This is my first attent to creatie an applicatie that lets you creatie or downloaden  a sudoku. Either a normale one, or a killer version or calcudoku.

The current version only does a killersudoku, with size 4x4 or 9x9. It does not generate a  playable version yet, you must set up an existing puzzel.  However, you can save suc a version and retrieve it later to continue the solvent. 

Right now, the solvent is very slow. For a 1 star problem of size 9x9, downloaded from the Internet,  the app needs a disappointing 15 seconde or so...

Enough for now, we'll continue this applicatie.
